## Areas for Improvement (Minor)

1. **Function Length:** 5 functions exceed 50 lines
   - Recommendation: Consider breaking down long functions into smaller helper methods
   - Priority: LOW (functions are well-documented and have clear purposes)

2. **Main Guards:** 2 files missing `if __name__ == '__main__'` guards
   - Files: `ml_config_loader.py`, `ml_integration_adapter.py`
   - Priority: LOW (these are library modules, not meant to be executed directly)

3. **Comment Density:** Some files have low comment ratios
   - Recommendation: Add inline comments for complex algorithms
   - Priority: LOW (code is self-documenting with good naming)
