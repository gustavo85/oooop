- Use thread pools for I/O-bound operations (file access, registry operations)
- Implement progress callbacks for lengthy operations
- Add operation cancellation support

**Impact:** More responsive UI and better user experience

### 1.5 Code Modularity and Testing
**Current Issue:** Large functions with multiple responsibilities make testing difficult.

**Improvement:**

- Add unit tests for core algorithms (ML predictions, optimization logic)
- Implement integration tests for critical paths
- Add docstring examples that can be run as doctests
- Create mock objects for Windows API calls to enable testing on non-Windows platforms
